## The river, the explorer and the king

Back in late 19th century, Britain was the dominator of the world. In 1860s Britain legally abolished slavery because it contrasted to the “British moral and virtue”. It was time that European newspapers often published condemnations on Arab slave traders.
However, in practice it was time of climax of colonialism: the entire American continent experienced colonization from different European countries. While USA was established and just experienced its civil war, many Latin American countries were still struggling for independence. In comparison, African continent remained mostly unknown because of its complex geographical condition, such as extreme humid weather and potential plague were still lethal obstacle for European Explorers.

Newspapers boasted expedition in the deep inland Africa led by “heroic, individual great explorers”. Livingstone and Stanley are both names of explorers and they are also names of major Congo natural spectacles as explorers named their findings after themselves.
Both Livingstone and Stanley are inscribed into the great Congo River. David Livingstone was the first white man to cross African continent from coast to coast with the help of boating in Congo River, and his name was used to name a group of great waterfalls in the downstream Congo River. Livingstone Waterfalls are less than 300 hundred miles from the entrance to Atlantic Ocean.

Stanley, Livingstone’s successor who later became attorney of Belgian king, named two important geographical spots after himself, Stanley Pool and Stanley Fall. Stanley Pool, now named Pool Malebo, is just above Livingstone fall. Stanley falls, now named Boyama falls, is near upstream Congo city Kisangani. Between Stanley Pool and Stanley Falls is over 900 miles of navigable waterway that could carry almost any watercraft in the 19th century. In the map the shape of this waterway is like a bend string that encircles most part of the Congo Basin.
The Welsh-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley knew exactly the value of his finding: it is a vast land of wealth, to plunder which did not need railway construction. With some clever tactics to overcome the Livingstone Waterfalls, the remaining navigable Congo River can act as a major transportation route from inland Africa to the Atlantic Ocean. Plunderers obtained goods from Congo forests and transported them through the Congo River, as smoothly as red blood cells carry nutrition to another part of body through the vein.
