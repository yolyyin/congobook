## The papers brought to the king, the brass cords brought to indigenous chief

There is something very unique in conquering Congo. First, Congo’s colonist Belgium was a new-born independent kingdom in 1830. Leopold Second was the first person who was born to inherent the country, while his father was “made” the king from a German aristocrat in his adulthood. The game of colonization was quite mature then, and Leopold Second soon taught himself the advantage of being a king, which is to acquire a piece of colony to gather personal wealth.

Second, in the end of the 19th century, Europe had experienced both enlightenment and colonization for a long time. The use of idea and force was then arranged as such: The development of oversea colonies was boasted in newspapers under the title of free trade, emancipation and philanthropic “education”, while in practice it was often brutal plunder of natural resource with forced labor system. If a well-educated European citizen that really believed in enlightenment value came to colony land of his country in person, he could get hugely puzzled by the gap between what he was taught and what actually happened in front of his eyes. This emotion is the plot of the famous novel Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, in which the main character is deeply perplexed, as although he is travelling to Congo in person, he cannot really understand the violence he is experiencing.
For a European king to smoothly run the business of colonization, it was necessary for him to cover his plan under the name of company business; also, in order to avoid condemnation on invading another country, this company sould be personally owned by the king, so he was doing personal business; his action was less politically sensitive.
Leopold Second knew the game rules. He established a company called “the international association of Congo”, and sponsored Henry Morton Stanley as his personal attorney to sail along the Congo River. The requirement was that Stanley brought back treaty paper signed by local tribe leaders he met on the way.

A typical treaty was written in below format:

_**In return for “one piece of cloth per month to each of the undersigned chiefs, besides present of cloth in hand”, “freely of their own accord, for themselves and their heirs and successors forever…give up to the said Association the sovereignty and all sovereign and governing rights to all their territories… and to assist by labor or otherwise, any works, improvements or expeditions which the said Association shall cause at any time to be carried out in any part of these territories…All roads and waterways running through this country, the right of collecting tolls on the same, and all game, fishing ,mining and forest rights, are to be the absolute property of the said Association.”**_

The indigenous tribes Stanley made treaty with hardly developed writing characters. They could barely understand what rights they gave out by barely drawing a sign on some papers. Yet the Belgian king succeeded in lobbying around the world to ask major governments to admit the legal power of these treaties. Three conditions made his lobby successful: first, he sold the ideology that this company was philanthropic to educate indigenous human-beings; second, he promised trade priority to supporting governments; third, he took advantage of the complex political conflicts between large countries that made them think Belgium was better than a larger rival to take control of the grand land. After 1884, US, France, Britain and German all acknowledged Leopold Second’s right in Congo. Leopold Second was the chief of the international association of Congo, and the association was the controller of Congo. Leopold Second had some modern sense that it should be an economical organization independent from national government that run the oversea business.
