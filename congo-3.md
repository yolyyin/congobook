## Fragments of violence

In psychology, if a major trauma is posed on a person, he can get two kinds of mind structures: 1. the meaning of the whole issue was left in oblivion; 2. some detail sceneries can repeatedly harass his mind. It is very interesting to ask if this is also true at a collective level: as in Congo, on one hand the record of past violence is fragmentary; on the other hand, similar violent sceneries seemed to repeat in later history.
When I want to dig into the past history of Congo and Belgian colonizers, I found a mysterious lack of record considering it was not really far from us. Most records are about how Belgian colonizers organized local labor, or how many ports were built, or what architecture plan was adopted. Very few records were about how to treat native people. However, there are traces, signs and fragments in text records that can prove extreme violence.

Here is the voice of a Congolese women, Ilanga, recorded by Edgar Canisius, American Swahili-speaking state agent:

_**“….When the white men and their warriors had gone, we went again to our work, and were hoping that they would not return; but this they did in a very short time. As before, we brought in great heaps of food; but this time Kibalanga did not move away directly, but camped near our villages, and his soldiers came and stole all our fowls and goats and tore up our cassava; but we did not mind that as long as they did not harm us. The next morning…soon after the sun rose over the hill, a large band of soldiers came into the village, and we all went into the houses and sat down. We were not long seated when the soldiers came rushing in shouting, and threatening Niendo with their guns. They rushed into the houses and dragged the people out. Three or four came to our house and caught hold of me, also my husband Oleka and my sister Katinga. We were dragged into the road, and were tied together with cords about our necks, so that we could not escape. The soldiers beat us with the iron sticks from their guns, and compelled us to march to the camp of Kibalanga, who ordered the women to be tied up separately, ten to each cord, and the men in the same way. When we were all collected—and there were many from other villages whom we now saw, and many from Waniendo—the soldiers brought baskets of food for us to carry, in some of which was smoked human flesh…**_

_**We then set off marching very quickly. My sister Katinga had her baby in her arms, and was not compelled to carry a basket; but my husband Oleka was made to carry a goat. We marched until the afternoon, when we camped near a stream, where we were glad to drink, for we were much athirst. We had nothing to eat, for the soldiers would give us nothing… The next day we continued the march, and when we camped at noon were given some maize and plantains, which were gathered near a village from which the people had run away. So it continued each day until the fifth day, when the soldiers took my sister’s bay and threw it in the grass, leaving it to die, and made her carry some cooking pots which they found in the deserted village. On the sixth day we became very weak from lack of food and from constant marching and sleeping in the damp grass, and my husband, who marched behind us with the goat, could not stand up longer, and so he sat down beside the path and refused to walk more. The soldiers beat him, but still he refused to move. Then one of them struck him on the head with the end of his gun, and he fell upon the ground. One soldier caught the goat, while two or three others stuck the long knives they put on the ends of their guns into my husband. I saw the blood spurt out, and then saw him no more, for we passed over the brow of a hill and he was out of sight. Many of the young men were killed the same way, and many babies thrown into the grass to die…After marching ten days we came to the great water…and were taken in canoes across to the white men’s town at Nyangwe.”**_  **[1]**

Here continues some fragmentary records of violence happening in Congo when it was Belgian colony.

**The Chicotte:**

Lepord Second’s actual right was guaranteed by his militia called Force Publique, which was established in 1885 under the king’s leadership, and the army’s major object was to build a force labor system that could plunder and transport valued raw materials to the trade ports in Europe. Black labors were conscripted into the system step by step as colonizers changed their business plan with time. At the beginning their mind was haunted by the conspicuous wealth, ivories, and the key factor of the hunting business was transportation, thus native Congolese were widely recruited as porters.

They were forced to labor, and were usually chained on the necks in lines. A special weapon called “chicotte” was applied, which was a whip of sun-dried hippopotamus hide that was cut into a long sharp-edged corkscrew strip. The victims captured were punished heavily with chicotte. Stanislas Lefranc, a Belgian magistrate described one such scene: “The station chief selects the victims…Trembling, haggard, they lie face down on the ground …two of their companions, sometimes four, seize them by the feet and hands, and remove their cotton drawers…Each time that the torturer lifts up the chicotte, a reddish stripe appears on the skin of the pitiful victims, who, however firmly held, gasp in frightful contortions…At the first blows the unhappy victims let out horrible cries which soon become faint groans…In a refinement of evil, some officers, and I’ve witnessed this, demand that when the sufferer gets up, panting, he must graciously give the military solute.  **[2]**  

**The Hostages Taken:**

The forced labor system in 19th century Congo upgraded as the plunder object transferred from ivory to a new hot commodity, rubber. The industrial development in Europe made it important materials. The collection of natural rubber consumed the highest level of manual labor. The wood in Congo that generated rubber was a kind of long spongy vine twining around very tall trees. To collect rubber, workers had to climb on tall trees to approach the vines in heavy labor. Also, The growth of rubber vines cost long period of time. As a result in order to satisfy high demand, all the rubber collected in Congo was gathered from wild woods, which means rubber plants around residential places were soon drained out, and gatherers were forced to go deep into dangerous forests and swampland to search for new plants.

Local Congolese were more than reluctant to do this hard labor. In order to force them to do the business, the Belgian company promulgated a “quota” policy onto Congo villages. Usually a quota of a large amount of rubber per adult per month was distributed to each village. The Force Publique was assigned to supervise the village and their method was barbarian and simple: they controlled local people by kidnapping hostages. They captured women and children as a way to make male labor subdue. As recorded by a British vice consul, “This officer’s method…was to arrive in canoes at a village, the inhabitants of which invariably bolted on their arrival; the soldiers were then landed, and commenced looting, taking all the chickens, grains, out of the houses; after this they attacked the natives until able to seize their women; these women were kept as hostages until the Chief of the district brought in the required number of kilograms of rubber. The rubber having been brought, the women were sold back to their owners for a couple of goats apiece, and so he continued from village to village until the requisite amount of rubber had been collected.”  **[3]**  

When a group of people no longer saw the other group of people as equal human-beings, then the obvious method of exploitation is through pure terror.

**The Severed Hands:**

A somewhat symbolic crime that happened at that that time was that severed hands were collected by soldiers of the Force Publique according to the military command. They did this to provide evidence of the “correct use” of bullet cartridge. After soldiers get their bullet distribution, they must provide equal numbers of hands cut from the victim corpse as the proof that they did not store bullets stealthily or used them for private hunting. In 1899, a black American missionary William Sheppard encountered such a scene: he entered a military camp where a pile of severed hands were being smoked. “The chief conducted us to a framework of sticks, under which was burning a slow fire, and there they were, the right hands, I counted them, 81 in all.” And the chief also told him, “See! Here is our evidence. I always have to cut off the right hands of those we kill in order to show the state how many we have killed.”  **[4]**  And the purpose of smoking was to preserve the hands from decay before display in front of superior officials.

Soldiers had their own trick to play: they also cut living people’s hands to compensate inadequate numbers, which led to even more evil crimes: there are many photographs taken then on handicapped black natives. This is a crime because of “official rules”. It was not a perverse individual, but the system that came up with an idea of pure menace.
