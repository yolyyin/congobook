## Mass Killings in Democratic Republic of Congo in the current time

The chaotic military conflict of the current Democratic Republic of Congo had its beginning trigger in its neighbor country: in April 1994, the Hutu majority Rwandan government conducted genocide on Tutsi people, one of Rwandan minority ethnic groups, and it killed up to 1 million Tutsi population. Later in Rwandan civil war the Tutsi military power Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) fought back and regained the control of the state. As the result of fear of revenge, more than 2 million Rwandan refugees (mostly Hutus) fled their home country. Some of them crossed the west borders and entered the bushes and forests of east Democratic Republic of Congo. As these fleeing Rwandan Hutu soldiers did not come with bare hands, they established a heavily armed rebel army called Democratic Force for the Liberation of Rwanda, abbreviated FDLR. FDLR provoked chain reaction in DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo). The number of independent military powers boosted either as imitators or revengers.

Racial hatred plays a vital role in military conflicts. Rebel groups in DRC mostly have an ethnical identity at their backs. The M23 group, formerly named CNDP, is mostly made up with Tutsi soldiers, and it is enemy to FDLR. Notorious LRA group from Uganda was a result of conflict between Acholi and Baganda people. Mai Mai groups were built up by local northeast Congolese villagers in kivu states, and their major appeal is to defend Rwanda invaders.

It is true that military conflicts in DRC have its racism context, yet if we ponder closely and ask if these conflicts are purely because of fundamentalism ideology, there is no simple answer. What is unique about DRC situation is that the militia is sporadic and taking actions in small groups. East DRC villages experience harass from militias on an everyday-life level. The attack on ordinary civilians is not a side effect of Congo rebel militias, but rather their planned agenda in order to self-sustain.

Let’s take a look at different killing stories and reflect on what is behind them.

Peter Eichstaedt recorded the story of a Congo village being repeatedly slaughtered in his nonfiction Consuming Congo. The village is called Bogoro at a strategic location less than one day walk from Congo city Bunia. As having mostly Hema population, the village experienced rounds of attacks from rival ethnic, Lentus. The first attack was conducted in January 2001 by the Front for National Integration (FNI), a Lentu militia formed to conter the rising strength and influence of a Hema homegrown group, the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC). The 2 day slaughter caused 98 deaths, and it provoked instant revenge from nearby Hema villages on Lendu villages. In August 2002, the village was attacked again by another militia, Tutsi people’s the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD), which was a revenge because of Lentu-RCD conflicts in Bunia on February. The Attack caused 32 deaths. The third round of racial massacre happened on February 24, 2003, as another Lentu militia, the Force de Resistance Patriotique en Ituri (FRPI) backed up by Ugandan army tried to retake control of Bunia from Hema militia group. This attack was an especially ferocious one as the official order was to “wipe out” Bogoro so as to dislodge the Hema militias. At least 275 villagers were killed.  **[1]** We can see that in Bogoro’s issue racial hatred was the vital element responsible for mass killings. The wandering militias of different ethnics in DRC mercilessly got used to kill hapless civilians as a tool to threaten and/or revenge on each other, and there’s no alternative mechanism to stop a chain reaction of revenges.

Thomas Morton recorded interviews with the community members of Bangadi, which revealed the fundamentally evil side of rebel militias. Bangadi is a north-east DRC village that was being heavily harassed by LRA. Sporadic small groups of LRA hid themselves in the bushes around the town. The rebel militia turned into very scattered gangs of mafias and they robbed and killed individual villager that coincidently run into their controlled territory. The locals commented on the cause of attacking, _**“The problem is not linked to (particular) time, but it’s when they are hungry they look for food. As of now, it is the period of peanuts and corn, they arrive in peanuts and corn field, they settle to supply themselves food, sometimes get cassava as well, before looking forward to their next step.” “They came with all manners. If they can kill, they kill. They also came when there’s opportunity to kidnap children.”**_ Food robbery, abduction and sexual attack seemed to be the real reason for repeated harassment and killings. Here is no minimum fight for ideology or any other political purpose, but it is nude demand from a gang of males to sustain its own existence at expense of others’ blood.

The ethnic conflicts in east DRC exploded time after time and are especially intensified after 1998. The fighting usually did not last long, confronted militias would meet and reach a temporary cease-fire. Yet every explosion of next round conflicts lead to violence on civilians. For ordinary Congolese residents, it is endless killing after killing.

The attacks are not only annoying, but seriously confusing. In Peter Eichstaedt’s story villagers in Bogoro expressed full perplexity of their misery. The “why they kill” question is beyond possibility to answer. One villager, Mugeni, said in desperate, _**“we have never understood why they were fighting.”**_ Peter Eichstaedt commented more than once in his book that the strange thing of his victim interviewees is that _**“they shook head if being asked if they are angry”**_.  **[2]** The psychological impact on victims is worth pondering, as any attempt to rebuild the community needs participation of initiative members, yet now traumatic villagers showed pure acceptance rather than thoughts of changing.

In Thomas Morton’s interview, similar opinion is expressed: The radical cause beneath the Congo violence has never been reached, yet the prevalent attitude of acceptance of the situation is a symbol of despair. As Thomas put, _**“there’s an attitude you see in all kinds of NGOs, that they have very narrow focus. They’re focused on one issue in a region, which is the way you do things. But in an area as complex as Eastern Congo, where everything is connected.” “Day by day, we can solve one peace at a time, and there’s no real way to do it. Solution will come eventually, but this is 20 years of war. That shit lingers. People take in and it becomes part of their lives. War and retribution and the cycles that are continuing to make it worse are part of life here.”**_  **[3]** During such long times of Chaos, daily violence on innocent victims can make the place an authentic hell. Local residents cannot run away, and their eternal endurance of nonsense violence is absurd, and inhuman.
