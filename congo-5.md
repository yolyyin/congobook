## Minerals feeds fire

The dark core of DRC’s rebel troops are their relations with global mineral market. Congo has significant mine reserves in demand by the world buyers including gold, coltan and tin.

Oft advocacies declares that Congo is largest supplying source of coltan, which is not true. According to Peter Eichstaedt’s confirmation with Tantalum Niobium International Study Center (Lasne, Belgium) and International Tin Association (ITRI, UK), Congo provides approximately 9% of world tantalum resource and 1%-2% of world tin resource. Among all the minerals Congo exports, gold is the biggest deal, amounting to about 55 percent of the total exported mineral value.  **[1]**  However, the investigation also suggests that it doesn’t take into account how much proportion of entire national GDP is contribute by mineral exportation inside Congo, which means for a country as underdeveloped as Congo, the ore mines can be the monopolistic way of earning. At least the business is worth enough for hundreds of rebel troops to compete, which in turn has caused millions of victims.

A typical business-military model was first constituted in the after effect of African Great War in the 1990s. In the chaotic anarchic situations, Ugandan and Rwandan invaders took opportunities to control the north part and east part of Congo. The invaders exploited the occupied areas by collecting tax from local miners. After retreatment of foreign invader in the beginning of 2000s, the factual control of mines was altered to the hands of various rebel militias. The troops often had an ethnic bond with neighbor countries and received weapon support from different government. These groups were self-sustained on mine. The exchange of the mine control between different militias was bloodshed, and civilian killing were often involved as a by-product of racial hatred.

In Peter Eichstated's Consuming the Congo, investigations on 2 mines were deeply reported: a Mongbwalu gold mine and a Goma coltan mine.

In 2002, Mongbwalu gold mine experienced a power takeover from Thomad Lubang's Hema troop UPC supported by Rwanda to Floribert Njabu’s Lentu troop FNI supported by Uganda. UPC first conducted a slaughter in Puto (a town around Mongbwalu) and then in Mongbwalu. The killing was a purge of rival race. It lasted for month through December 2002 till early 2003.

**A witness described following horrible scene:** 100 of Lentus were tied up and commanded to dig their own graves for execution. After the victims quickly dug an about four-feet-deep hole, they were hit on skull with a sledgehammer, then thrown into the holes, then the holes were filled up by successive victims. The short-life Hema reign was soon overthrown by Lentu troop FNI in March 2003, then a no less vicious ethnic vengeance on Hema was executed. Among all the most perverse penalty was a “witch hunt” launched in July 2003: Hema women were accused of spying in the Lentu families, staining Lentu blood by giving birth to mix-ethnicity children. Hema women captured from Mongbwalu, Pluto and Dego were congregated together in Pluto for a "spiritual ceremony". They were grouped in ten, tied up, imprisoned in a house and burnt together. The massacre lasted for two weeks, days and nights. Hema females were exterminated in the areas. Their husbands had no possible method to save their wives, and were even sometimes charged fees for "cleaning the execution knife that stained by the dirty blood".  **[2]**

The report on the coltan mine in Bibatama village near Goma showed the other side of mine violence: the normalization of mafia involement. The business had a clear system there:

At the bottom were the saporic local miners (very exclusive and hostile to any outsiders). Above were their cooperating organization called Co-operama and some other negociants; their job was to buy minerals from individual hands, store it, and kept connection with compoziors. Compoziors were the attorney of global companies with large order bills. Upon these selling channels both rebel militias and the government collected "tax". For example, for every truckload of coltan transported to Goma from the village, Combatants of CNDP (later changed to the name M23) charged 100 dollars, then in Goma airport (Goma's major transport hub to export coltan abroad), the government charged tax. So ironically the government army and rebel troops did not antagonize each other here. The local miners, though still frequently harassed, threatened and driven away by the rebel troops, were almost content that they had a stable way to earn money. As commented by Co-operama's negociant Mutazimiza, _**"If we do nothing, our communities will die. Taxes are common for other activities."**_  **[3]**

It is significant that in such normalized business model neither the government army (actually the government was trying to integrate M23 army into its name without actual leadership change) nor the local miners fought the rebel militias. The use of illegal military powers was accepted, making its future existence even stronger.
