## Militia dominance (FDLR)

Let’s take a look at some major rebel militias patrolling in the east part of Democratic Republic of Congo.

**FDLR:**

FDLR’s full name is the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, thus, it is actually a Rwanda force originating from Rwanda civil war after 1994. In 1994, part of the perpetuators of the world shocking Rwanda genocide fled to the Congo east border and consisted a guerrilla military called Army for the Liberation of Rwanda (ALiR), which recruited original members from Hutu interahamwe, and cooperated with Congolese President Laurent-Desire Kabila to fight against Rwandan government army, Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPF). When ALiR entered Congo, it accounted all its loss in the previous battles, regrouped with adjusted leadership and renamed into FDLR. In 2002, FDLR moved into North and South Kivu area and conducted consistent attacks on Tutsi forces both in eastern DRC and deep into Rwanda. The violence of FDLR widely affected local civilians’ life. In the year of 2004 statistics showed 25000 Congolese were forced to flee their homes because of FDLR attack.

**Cases of notorious attacks that were condemned as against human rights:**

Attack on villages of Ekingi and Busurungi on 9 and 10 May 2009. Evidence confirmed it was conducted in retaliation against the FARDC for the killings in late April 2009 at Shalio. More than 90 people were killed at Ekingi, including 60 civilians and 30 government troops, and ‘dozens more’ were said to be killed at Busurungi.

Attack on town Luvungi, raping and assaulting 154 civilians, from July to August 2010. The attack was marked by vicious sexual crimes and aroused United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon’s special concern.

**International arrest warrants and trials against FDLR:**

In November 2009, the German Bundeskriminalamt (Federal Criminal Police Office) captured Murwanashyaka, the 46-year-old chairman of the FDLR, along with his 48-year-old deputy, Straton Musoni. International trial was conducted afterwards in German.

In October 2010, the Executive Secretary of FDLR, Callixte Mbarushimana, was arrested in France under a sealed warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC).

On 13 July 2012, the ICC announced an arrest mandate against the FDLR chief Sylvestre Mudacumura.  **[1]**
