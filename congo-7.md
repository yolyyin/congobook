## Militia dominance (LRA)

The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is a rebel group and heterodox Christian cult which operated in northern Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its origin was rooted in Uganda’s ethnic conflict between Acholi People in the north who were historically hunting, farming and herding livestock and Baganda people in the south who were historically engaged in agriculture. Because of differentiation in economic status, after the colonial times, the Acholi people acquired majority control over the nation’s military and political power, whereas Baganda people successfully built close relation with the British, transforming the country’s southern part into trade centers. In 1986, because of racial hatred, the armed rebellion waged by Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA) carried out the Ugandan Bush War. It successfully captured national control. The victors sought vicious vengeance against ethnic groups in the North. Their activities included burning, looting, and killings of locals.

As a result of exacerbated ethnical conflicts, a civilian resistance movement colored in religious myth led by Alice Lakwena was formed in late 1987. Lakwena portrayed herself as a prophet who could receive messages from the Holy Spirit, and she preached with oracle that the Acholi would defeat the Museveni government. Joseph Kony, who later became LRA’s chief, aligned himself with Lakwena and in turn acquired support from her constituents. The rebel of LRA was functioned as following personal worship of Joseph Kony. Its stated goals included establishment of multi-party democracy, ruling Uganda according to the Ten Commandments, and Acholi nationalism. Although self-acclaimed as a religious power, LRA’s vicious abused violence on civilian had no difference from any anarchic militia. Evidence showed LRA had accepted military support from Sudan government.

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the LRA attacks and the government's counter-insurgency measures have resulted in the displacement of nearly 95 percent of the Acholi population in three districts of northern Uganda. By 2006, 1.7 million people lived in more than 200 internally displaced person (IDP) camps in northern Uganda. The Ugandan Ministry of Health and partners estimated that through the first seven months of 2005, about 1,000 people were dying weekly, chiefly from malaria and AIDS. During the same time period of January–July 2005, the LRA abducted 1,286 Ugandans (46.4 percent of whom were children under the age of 15 years), and violence accounted for 9.4 percent of the 28,283 deaths, occurring mostly outside camps. In 2006–2008, LRA forces left Uganda and gather in two assembly areas in the remote Garamba National Park area of northern Democratic Republic of Congo that the Ugandan government agreed not to attack. By August 2009, the LRA terror resulted in displacing as many as 320,000 Congolese.  **[1]**

**Cases of notorious attacks that were condemned as against human rights:**

During the Christmas of 2008, the LRA massacred at least 143 people and abducted 180 at a concert celebration sponsored by the Catholic Church in Faradje in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and struck several other communities in the near-simultaneous attacks: 75 people were murdered in a church near Dungu, at least 80 were killed in Batande, 48 in Bangadi, and 213 in Gurba.

In December 2009, the LRA killed at least 321 civilians and abducted 250 others during a four-day rampage in the village and region of Makombo DR Congo.

In February 2010, about 100 people were massacred by the LRA in Kpanga, near DR Congo's border with the Central African Republic and Sudan.  **[2]**

**International arrest warrants and trials against LRA:**

The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on 8 July and 27 September 2005, against Joseph Kony, his deputy Vincent Otti, and the LRA commanders Okot Odhiambo, deputy army commander and Dominic Ongwen, brigade commander of the Sania Brigade of the LRA. The four LRA leaders were charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder, rape, and sexual slavery. The warrants were filed under seal; public redacted versions were released on 13 October 2005.

On 2 June 2006, Interpol issued five wanted person red notices for the arrest of five LRA commanders to 184 countries on behalf of the ICC. The five commanders included Joseph Kony, Vincent Otti, Okot Odhiambo, Raska Luwiya and Dominic Ongwen. Three of the five wanted LRA leaders have since been killed: Lukwiya in August 2006 and Otti in late 2007 (executed by Kony). In February, 2015, UPDF forces found the body of an unidentified person. Later on in April, DNA tests identified that the body was that of Odhiambo. Ongwen was captured in 2014, and later ICC trials were open in 2015 and 2016. Joseph Kony is still at large by May 2018.   **[3]** **[4]**
