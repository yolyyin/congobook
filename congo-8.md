## Militia dominance (RCD&CNDP&M23)

The history and evolution RCD, CNDP and M23 is an exemplary episode of the mingled historical, political and ethnical factors that caused DRC chaos. The story began with the First Congo war, in which Hutu perpetuators of Rwanda genocide fled into east Congo. The post-colonial Congo dictator Mobutu supported the Hutu group, and then he fell from power under intervention of the Rwanda and Uganda government armies. The foreign powers substituted Laurent-Désiré Kabila, the leader of Tutsi force in South Kivu, for the president position. Kabila won the First Congo war with ADFL (Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo) with the aid of Rwanda and Uganda, yet after that Kabila began to alienate his Rwanda and Uganda allies. A break-up between Kabila and former ADFL members (mostly Tusi) in Banyamulenge along with cooperated Rwandans was catalyzed. These people regrouped themselves, formed a new army RCD against Kabila government, and took control of Goma in August 1998. This event was the trigger of the Second Congo War.

In the following years RCD experienced a series of divisions (into RCD-Kisangani and RCD-Goma), ending up assimilated into the government system. The Second Congo War ended in 2003 with an agreement to create a transitional government, and RCD took one out of four seats of vice presidents and 94 out of 500 seats of the National Assembly.

Despite that RCD dissolved, not all of its members were willing to surrender. Former RCD-Goma officer Laurent Nkunda, though offered a general position in the integrated national army, resisted authority from the government and rebelled in 2004. After a series of attacks engaging Tongo, Bunagana, Rutshuru and Goma, in December 2006 Nkunda reorganized remnants of RCD under his leadership, and named it National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP), the key group majorly responsible for the following long-tern Kivu conflict.  **[1]**

CNDP was consisted of all-Tusi units and it was the enemy of FDLR Hutu brigades most of the time. In January 2009, CNDP splintered as Bosco Ntaganda acclaimed that he had taken the leadership of CNDP from Nkunda, and Nkunda was later arrested in Rwanda on January 22th 2009. Bosco showed will to cooperate with the government on condition that imprisoned CNDP members got released. A peace treaty was made on March 2009 as CNDP agreed to become a legitimate political party. In the peacemaking process, about 6000 former CNDP soldiers were integrated into the government army. The UN Children's Fund has stated that the CNDP had verbally committed to release all child soldiers in its ranks.  **[2]**

However, confrontation resumed three year later in 2012. On 4 April 2012, nearly 300 former CNDP soldiers turned against the DRC government, citing its poor willingness to implement promises made in the 23 March 2009 peace deal, and formed a new rebel group with the name ‘March 23 Movement’ (M23). The newly formed M23 retook control of former CNDP territory in North Kivu, and resuscitated violence against civilian towns and villages. M23 was notorious for crime of child soldier use. In order to restock the troops, M23 required occupied villages to deliver youngsters for the formation of village defense committees, which was in fact compulsory child soldier recruitment. On November 20th 2012, M23 succeeded in occupying Goma, yet retreated from the city 10 days later under international pressure.

On October 25th 2013 DRC government army launched a major offensive against M23 in the east of the country. On November 5th 2013 M23 issued a document that said they had "decided from this day to end its rebellion" and instead to pursue its goals "through purely political means". On 7 November, Sultani Makenga the M23 leader at the time surrendered with about 1,500 M23 soldiers in the Mgahinga National Park of Uganda.   **[3]** **[4]**
