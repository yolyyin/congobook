## Militia dominance (Mai-Mai)

The term Mai-Mai or Mayi-Mayi refers to any kind of community-based militia group active in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), formed to defend their local territory against other armed groups. Most were formed to resist the invasion of Rwandan forces and Rwanda-affiliated Congolese rebel groups (such as Tutsi ethnical group RCD, CNDP and M23), but some may have formed to exploit the war for their own advantage by looting, cattle rustling or banditry.

Groups that fall under the umbrella term "Mai-Mai" include armed forces led by warlords, traditional tribal elders, village heads, and politically motivated resistance fighters. Because Mai Mai have had only the most tenuous internal cohesion, different Mai-Mai groups allied themselves with a variety of domestic and foreign government and guerrilla groups at different times. The term Mai-Mai does not refer to any particular movement, affiliation or political objective but to a broad variety of groups.

The term Mai-Mai does not refer to any particular movement, affiliation or political objective but to a broad variety of groups. Mai-Mai groups are particularly active in the Kivu areas in east DRC, where military mafias are the most rampant.  **[1]**

From the ideological perspective, many Mai-Mai groups claimed themselves to the “true patriot power” in DRC, fighting to defend foreign countries’ interference and protect local communities. Yet in practice large numbers of Mai-Mai groups are involved in brutal violence against civilians in territories. They looted both properties and labors for their own perverse profits, making their names the same notorious as other rebel militaries. The sexual crimes conducted by Mai-Mai is a particularly severe problem. As reported by western observers, in 2011, one of the Mai-Mai group leaders, Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka was under arrest warrant issued by DRC government for executing severe sexual violence. Sheka’s group was accused for rape crimes against nearly 400 civilians between July and August in a series of 13 villages in Walikale territory. Hunt and arrest for Sheka was difficult because the Mai-Mai group was operating in remote areas, and the criminal took advantage of frequently shifting alliance with either government officers or other rebel groups, so as to get protection.  **[2]** Like in Sheka’s case, Mai-Mai groups are frequently accused for being opportunists, taking advantage of the vacuum formed by conflicts between government army and rebels for its own sustainment. One article from 2008 New York Times commented, _**“The Mai Mai insist that they are Congo’s true patriots, but it is questionable how much influence they wield — most villagers call them crooks and they tend to lose their battles. In the past few weeks, they have emerged as spoilers, fighting on when the other armed groups have agreed to stop. ”**_  **[3]**
